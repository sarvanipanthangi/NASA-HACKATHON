Interactive Earth Systems Visualization Platform

Connected Earth is an interactive web-based platform designed to visualize the interconnected nature of Earth systems using real-time and historical NASA Earth observation data. The platform helps users explore how climate, rainfall, droughts, wildfires, vegetation, and air quality are spatially and temporally connected.
This project was developed as part of the NASA International Space Apps Challenge.

Project Motivation-

Earth’s systems—atmosphere, water cycles, vegetation, and wildfire dynamics—are deeply interconnected.
However, traditional tools often fail to present these complex relationships in an accessible and interactive way.
Connected Earth bridges this gap by:
Making NASA’s vast Earth observation datasets easy to explore
Providing interactive geospatial visualizations
Encouraging data-driven understanding of environmental interdependencies

Key Features

Interactive Web Maps-Zoomable and pannable maps built with Leaflet.js
Real-Time & Historical Data-Access current and past environmental data from NASA APIs
Customizable Data Layers-Explore different Earth systems such as:
  Rainfall
  Drought
  Wildfires
  Vegetation
  Air Quality

Location-Based Exploration
Users can select geographic coordinates to view region-specific insights

Visual Insights
Data presented through maps, lists, and charts for better interpretability
